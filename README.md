As Rocket League on Epic Games Launcher doesn't implement the workshop yet, this simple application will allow you to play Workshop maps (coming from Steam) into the Epic Games version.

## Prerequisites
Before using this application, make sure you have :
- **Windows 10** - For now, it only supports Windows
- **Java** - At least JDK 15 : https://www.oracle.com/fr/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
- **Workshop maps** - Go to https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/. Copy the map link you want to play (*ex : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=964271505*) and download it

## How does it work ?

## How to use

3. Find and select the map directory where you downloaded your workshop map(s)
4. Select the map you want to inject
5. Inject it
6. Go in Free Play and select the `Pillars - Footcar` map
7. If you want to restore the original map, just click the restore button
